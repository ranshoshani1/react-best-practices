### Controlled over uncontrolled components

- **Single Source of Truth**: The form data is stored in the component’s state, making it easier to manage and synchronize with the rest of the application.
- **Validation and Formatting**: You can easily validate or format the input value before updating the state, ensuring the data meets your requirements.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Allows for conditional rendering of elements based on the input state.
- **Debugging**: Easier to debug since the state reflects the form data, making it easier to trace issues.
- **Predictability**: The UI is driven by the state, leading to more predictable and reliable outcomes.
