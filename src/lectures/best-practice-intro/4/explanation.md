### Why Split State in React Functions?

1. **Better State Management**
   - **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each state piece has a clear responsibility, making code easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Avoid Unnecessary Re-renders**: Split state minimizes the risk of re-rendering components that don't need updating.

3. **Ease of Debugging**
   - **Simpler Debugging**: Isolates state changes, making it easier to identify issues.

4. **Granular Control**
   - **Focused State Updates**: Allows for more predictable and controlled state changes.

5. **Readability and Maintainability**
   - **Cleaner Code**: Results in smaller, more focused functions or hooks, improving code readability and maintenance.
