# Over-Generalization

**Over-generalization** refers to making components or code too generic or reusable, which can lead to unnecessary complexity and maintainability issues.

## Common Problems with Over-Generalization

1. **Overly Generic Components**
   - Components become bloated with too many props and configurations.

2. **Complex Logic**
   - Abstracting logic too much creates convoluted hooks or state management.
   - **Example**: A form component that handles all form types through complex configurations.

3. **Reduced Readability**
   - Components lose their clear intent, making them hard to understand.
   - Too much functionality in a single component leads to confusion.

4. **Performance Costs**
   - Generic components may run extra logic or checks, impacting performance.

5. **Unnecessary Abstraction**
   - Premature abstraction without a clear reuse pattern.
   - Adds complexity and extra work if the abstraction is not needed.

## How to Avoid Over-Generalization

1. **Start Simple**: Focus on specific use cases, and generalize later if patterns emerge.
2. **Favor Composition Over Configuration**: Use smaller, purpose-driven components.
3. **Use Specific Components**: Itâ€™s better to have multiple, clear components than one mega-component.
4. **Refactor When Necessary**: Generalize only when you clearly need to.
